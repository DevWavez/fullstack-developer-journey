# Day 4 – LocalStorage & Persistence

## Goal

Learn how to persist application state using `localStorage` so data survives page reloads.

## What I learned

- How `localStorage` works in the browser
- Why arrays and objects must be stored as JSON
- How to load data from `localStorage` on page load
- How to keep UI and state in sync

## Key Concepts

- `JSON.stringify()` to save arrays/objects
- `JSON.parse()` to restore data
- Updating `localStorage` after every state change
- Rendering UI based on stored state

## Features

- Add tasks
- Remove tasks
- Persist tasks using `localStorage`
- Restore tasks on page reload

## Notes

This was the first step toward real application state management.
