# Day 3 – Forms & Events (JavaScript)

## 🎯 Goal

Learn how to handle user input using forms and events in JavaScript and dynamically update the DOM based on user interaction.

## 🧠 What I learned

- Selecting DOM elements with `getElementById`
- Reading values from input fields
- Handling click events with `addEventListener`
- Using conditional logic (`if / else`) for validation
- Updating the DOM dynamically with `textContent`
- Basic input validation (minimum length)

## 🧪 Features

- User can enter a name into an input field
- Button click triggers JavaScript logic
- Validation checks if the input has at least 3 characters
- Dynamic feedback is shown directly on the page (no alerts)

## 📂 Files

- `index.html` – Markup for input and button
- `script.js` – JavaScript logic for events and validation
- `README.md` – Documentation for this day

## 🚀 Result

This exercise demonstrates basic form handling and event-driven programming, which are essential for interactive frontend applications such as login forms and user inputs.
